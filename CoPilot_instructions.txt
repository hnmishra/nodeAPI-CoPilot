This REST API needs user authentication.
Users must be able to register (signup) and login.
Don't add any JWT code or anything like that, just generate User model (without using classes) in the models folder
Also generate sign up and login routes (e.g. /users/signup) in the rouges folder.
Last but not least add the code for linking route and model to a user controller (Controller folder).
Don't add any code to for storing user data in the database yet.
Write standalone functions with export and import in all files.
Add code in the respective files
